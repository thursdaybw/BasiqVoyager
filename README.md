# Project Title: BasicVoyager 

# Project Overview:

The project aims to integrate allow the user to connect to the their bank via PHP and get their account balance. The Basiq API was found to be a simple, accessible and inexpensive service to provide the API access and thus retrieve account balance information for a specific savings account at a specific bank. The user is a PHP developer who is familiar with APIs but had difficulty understanding how to use the Basiq dashboard and API.

The project is divided into two main phases:

[**Phase 1 - Research available banking API services and tools**](web/docs/Phase_1_-_Research_available_banking_API_services_and_tools-blog.md): This phase was an exploratory one, involving Google searches, research on Open Banking and CDR, all in an attempt to find the easiest, publicly and legitimately available banking API that I didn't need to build myself.

[**Phase 2 - Understanding Basiq API and Dashboard**](web/docs/Phase_2_-_Understanding_Basiq_API_and_Dashboard-status.md): This phase focuses on understanding the Basiq API and Dashboard, providing a general overview of the Basiq API and Dashboard, addressing specific queries about the Basiq API and Dashboard, and getting a highlevel understanding of dashboard, API and Application.

[**Phase 3 - Setting up the Development Environment**](web/docs/Phase_3_-_Setting_up_the_Development_Environment-status.md): This phase also includes setting up the necessary development environment with Docker and Lando, to acheive a "Hello World!" in a browser from a local webserver.

[**Phase 4 - Configuring Basiq API Dashboard and Generating API Key**](web/docs/Phase_4_-_Configuring_Basiq_API_Dashboard_and_Generating_API_Key-status.md): This phase will swtiched focus back to the Basiq API Dashboard, configure the Demo Application and generating an API key.

[**Phase 5 - Implementing Basiq API into the Web Application**](web/docs/Phase_5_-_Implementing_Basiq_API_into_the_Web_Application-status.md): This phase will focus on the actual implementation of the Basiq API into the user's web application. We will look at the API docs for Basiq and make our first API call via PHP curl command. [blog](web/docs/Phase_5_-_Implementing_Basiq_API_into_the_Web_Application-blog.md)



This includes setting up a local web server, implementing user authentication, retrieving account balance information, displaying account balance information, and error handling and testing.
