# Basiq API Integration for a Simple Web Application

## Project Overview

The project aims to integrate the Basiq API into a simple web application to retrieve account balance information for a specific savings account at a specific bank. The user is a PHP developer who is familiar with APIs but had difficulty understanding how to use the Basiq dashboard and API.

The project is divided into two main phases:

1. **Phase 1**: This phase focuses on understanding the Basiq API and Dashboard, providing a general overview of the Basiq API and Dashboard, addressing specific queries about the Basiq API and Dashboard, and providing a step-by-step guide for Basiq API integration. This phase also includes setting up the necessary development environment with Docker and Lando.

2. **Phase 2**: This phase will focus on the actual implementation of the Basiq API into the user's web application. This includes setting up a local web server, implementing user authentication, retrieving account balance information, displaying account balance information, and error handling and testing.
