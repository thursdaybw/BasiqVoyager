# Project Title: Basiq API Integration for a Simple Web Application

# Project Overview:

The project aims to integrate the Basiq API into a simple web application to retrieve account balance information for a specific savings account at a specific bank. The user is a PHP developer who is familiar with APIs but had difficulty understanding how to use the Basiq dashboard and API.

The project is divided into two main phases:

1. **Phase 1**: This phase focuses on understanding the Basiq API and Dashboard, providing a general overview of the Basiq API and Dashboard, addressing specific queries about the Basiq API and Dashboard, and getting a highlevel understanding of dashboard, API and Application.

2. **Phase 2** This phase also includes setting up the necessary development environment with Docker and Lando, to acheive a "Hello World!" in a browser from a local webserver.

3. **Phase 3**: This phase will swtiched focus back to the Basiq API Dashboard, configure the Demo Application and generating an API key.

3. **Phase 3**: This phase will focus on the actual implementation of the Basiq API into the user's web application. We will look at the API docs for Basiq and make our first API call via PHP curl command.

This includes setting up a local web server, implementing user authentication, retrieving account balance information, displaying account balance information, and error handling and testing.
