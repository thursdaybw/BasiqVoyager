# Navigating the Basiq API: A Journey of Discovery

When it comes to exploring a new API, the journey is often filled with twists and turns. My recent experience with the Basiq API was no exception. In this post, I'll share my journey from creating an account to setting up a demo application, including all the roadblocks and decisions along the way.

## Starting Point: Account Creation

The journey began after I had created my Basiq account. The account creation process was straightforward, but the real challenge lay ahead: setting up an application and generating an API key.

## The First Roadblock: Registering an Application

The first step was to register an application. I logged into the Basiq dashboard and was immediately faced with a decision: should I create a new application or use the existing "Demo Application"?

After some exploration, I discovered that clicking on "Demo Application" took me to a page with details about the demo application, including an option to create an API key. However, I also found an option to create a new application.

## The Decision: Using the Demo Application

After weighing the options, I decided to use the "Demo Application". This decision was based on my goal of just wanting to get basic authenticated access to the Basiq API. Using the demo application seemed like the quickest way to achieve this.

## The Second Roadblock: Creating an API Key

With the decision made, I proceeded to create an API key. This is where I encountered the next roadblock: setting permissions. The Basiq API uses "Permission Sets" to specify which endpoints an API key can access. However, I was unfamiliar with the API and didn't know which endpoints to select.

## The Catch-22: Setting Permissions

I felt like I was in a catch-22 situation. I didn't know what endpoints to select because I was not familiar with the API, and I was not familiar with the API because I was still trying to get access to it.

After some research and exploration, I discovered that I could select "Not set" for the permission set, which would give my API key access to all service endpoints. This was marked in red, probably because it's generally not a recommended practice for security reasons to give full access unless necessary. However, for my current purpose of just getting started and exploring the API, it seemed like the best option.

## The Relief: API Key Generated

With the "Not set" option selected, I was able to generate my API key. This was a major milestone in my journey. I now had the key to unlock the Basiq API.

## The Next Steps: Configuring the Application

With the API key in hand, the next steps were to configure the demo application's consent policy and available institutions. This involved setting up details like duration, title & subtitle, purposes, permissions, and supporting parties for the consent policy, and selecting the financial institution where my account is held.

## The Journey Continues

As I continue to explore the Basiq API, I'm sure there will be more roadblocks and decisions to navigate. However, I'm also confident that with each challenge, I'll gain a deeper understanding of the API and how to use it effectively.
