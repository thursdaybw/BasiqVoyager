# Blog: BasicVoyager - Putting a toe in the Basiq API waters

## Introduction

Greetings, fellow PHP developers! I'm John, and I've embarked on a journey to integrate the Basiq API into a straightforward web application. The objective? To fetch account balance details for a specific savings account from a specific bank. Although I'm well-versed with APIs, I found the Basiq dashboard and API somewhat challenging to comprehend. 

## Understanding the Basiq API

The initial phase was all about getting to grips with the Basiq API and dashboard. I began with a broad overview of the Basiq API and dashboard. I had some specific questions about the Basiq API and dashboard and needed a step-by-step guide for Basiq API integration. I was uncertain about the relationship between the Basiq dashboard and API, how to configure the dashboard, and how to use the API to fetch account balance information. Fortunately I with the help of ChatGPT being able to fill in the blanks, I was able to ascertain a generale idea and picture of how the Dashboard, API and "My Application" fit together. 

## Conclusion

The author has an better understanding of the ingrations between the Basiq Dashboard, the API end points and the Application.
In the next phase will will dive into setting up a develope ment evioronment to run code and provide a webserver as we will need this when we want to test the API configurations.
