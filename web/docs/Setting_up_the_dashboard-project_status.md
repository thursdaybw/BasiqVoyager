# Assignment name: Basiq Voyager Dashboard Setup

## Executive Summary 

The Basiq Voyager project involves setting up an application to connect with the Basiq API, which provides a secure and simple way to connect with financial institutions and retrieve user-consented financial data. This data can be used to build financial services applications, perform affordability assessments, verify account details, and more. The project has involved registering an application, generating an API key, setting up a consent policy, and selecting available institutions.

To start using the Basiq API, you'll need to register your application and configure it according to your needs. This process involves creating an API key for authentication and setting up your application's consent policy and available institutions. Once completed, you'll be able to make authenticated requests to the Basiq API.

1. **Register the application**
   - Status: Completed
2. **Generate API key**
   - Status: Completed
3. **Set up consent policy**
   - Status: Completed
4. **Select available institutions**
   - Status: Completed
