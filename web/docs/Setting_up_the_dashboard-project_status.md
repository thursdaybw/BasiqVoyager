**Background**
Basiq is a platform that provides a secure and simple way to connect with financial institutions, enabling you to retrieve user-consented financial data over a specified period of time. This data can be used to build financial services applications, perform affordability assessments, verify account details, and more.

To start using the Basiq API, you'll need to register your application and configure it according to your needs. This process involves creating an API key for authentication and setting up your application's consent policy and available institutions. Once completed, you'll be able to make authenticated requests to the Basiq API.

**Step 1: Register your application**
- Go to the Basiq dashboard. If you don't have an account yet, you'll need to create one.
- Look for an option to register or create a new application. This is usually a button or a link.
- Provide the necessary information to register your application. This typically includes the application's name and possibly a description.
- After registering your application, you'll need to create an API key. This key is used to authenticate your application when making requests to the Basiq API. Make sure to keep this key secret as it will only be exposed in full once.

**Step 2: Configure your application**
- In the Basiq dashboard, find your newly registered application and look for an option to configure or manage it.
- Configure your application's consent policy. This includes details like duration, title & subtitle, purposes, permissions, and supporting parties. Make sure these details accurately reflect your application's needs and comply with the rules and requirements as proposed by the CDR and defined within the latest CX guidelines.
- Configure your available institutions. This involves selecting from a list of institutions which ones you would like to present to your end users. This selection can be based on the needs of your application and your end users.

Once you've completed these steps, you should be able to start making authenticated requests to the Basiq API. This will allow you to retrieve user-consented financial data, which can be used to build your application or service.
