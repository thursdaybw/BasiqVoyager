# Project Report: Basiq API Integration for a Simple Web Application - Phase 1

## Project Overview

The project aims to integrate the Basiq API into a simple web application to retrieve account balance information for a specific savings account at a specific bank. The user is a PHP developer who is familiar with APIs but had difficulty understanding how to use the Basiq dashboard and API. The project is divided into two main phases:

1. **Phase 1: Understanding and Planning for Basiq API Integration**: This phase focuses on understanding the Basiq API and Dashboard, providing a general overview of the Basiq API and Dashboard, addressing specific queries about the Basiq API and Dashboard, and providing a step-by-step guide for Basiq API integration. This phase also includes setting up the necessary development environment with Docker and Lando.

2. **Phase 2: Basiq API Integration for a Simple Web Application**: This phase will focus on the actual implementation of the Basiq API into the user's web application. This includes setting up a local web server, implementing user authentication, retrieving account balance information, displaying account balance information, and error handling and testing.

We are currently in Phase 1 of the project.

## Executive Summary 

This phase of the project focused on understanding the Basiq API and planning for its integration into a simple web application. The goal is to retrieve account balance information for a specific savings account at a specific bank. The user, a PHP developer, needed assistance in understanding how to use the Basiq dashboard and API. 

## Challenge Description 

The user was unsure about the relationship between the Basiq dashboard and API, how to configure the dashboard, and how to use the API to retrieve account balance information. The user's application is a simple web application, which can handle HTTP redirects, a key part of the OAuth2 authentication process.

## Initial Plan: 

1. **Understanding Basiq API and Dashboard**
   - Status: Completed
2. **Providing General Overview of Basiq API and Dashboard**
   - Status: Completed
3. **Addressing Specific Queries about Basiq API and Dashboard**
   - Status: Completed
4. **Providing a Step-by-Step Guide for Basiq API Integration**
   - Status: Completed

## Actions Taken 

1. Provided a detailed explanation of the Basiq platform, its dashboard, API, and how they relate to each other.
2. Addressed specific queries about the Basiq dashboard and API.
3. Provided a general step-by-step guide on how to use the Basiq dashboard and API to retrieve account balance information.

## Conclusion

The user now has a better understanding of the Basiq platform and how to use its dashboard and API. The next phase of the project will involve setting up a local development environment using Docker and Lando.

## Recommended Next Steps 

1. **Install Docker for Lando Compatibility**
   - Task: Guide the user through the process of installing Docker on their Manjaro Linux system for compatibility with Lando.
   - Status: Not Started
2. **Install Lando**
   - Task: Guide the user through the process of installing Lando manually from the GitHub releases page.
   - Status: Not Started
