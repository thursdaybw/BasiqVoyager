# Blog Post: Basiq API Integration for a Simple Web Application - The Journey So Far

## Overview

The journey of integrating the Basiq API into a simple web application has been an exciting one, filled with learning, challenges, and a few unexpected turns. As a PHP developer familiar with APIs, I embarked on this journey with the aim of retrieving account balance information for a specific savings account at a specific bank. The project was divided into two main phases: understanding and planning for Basiq API integration, and setting up the local development environment. 

## Researching for a Relevant API Service

The first step in this journey was to find a suitable API service that could provide the necessary account balance information. After some research, I settled on the Basiq API. Basiq is a platform that provides a secure and simple way to connect with financial data. Their API seemed to offer exactly what I needed for my web application.

## Learning About Basiq API

The next step was to understand how to use the Basiq API and Dashboard. This was a bit of a challenge at first, as the Basiq Dashboard and API were new to me. However, with some time and effort, I was able to get a good grasp of how to use them. I learned how to make API requests, handle responses, and navigate the Basiq Dashboard. This knowledge was crucial for the next phase of the project.
