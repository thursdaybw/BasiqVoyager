# Status: BasiqVoyager - Phase 6 - Implementing Basiq API into the Web Application
=======
# Assignment name: Phase 6 - Creating a user in your application via the PHP API

## Executive Summary 

In Phase 6 of the BasiqVoyager project, we successfully created a user in the application via the Basiq API using PHP. This phase involved understanding the Basiq API's user creation process, writing a PHP script to send a POST request to the API, and debugging the script to ensure it worked correctly. The user creation process involved sending user data, including an email and mobile number, to the Basiq API. The API then returned a response indicating whether the user was successfully created or if there were any errors.

## Plan: 

1. **Understand the Basiq API's user creation process** 
   - Status: Completed 
2. **Write a PHP script to send a POST request to the Basiq API** 
   - Status: Completed 
3. **Debug the PHP script to ensure it works correctly** 
   - Status: Completed 

Absolutely, here's a more detailed breakdown:
