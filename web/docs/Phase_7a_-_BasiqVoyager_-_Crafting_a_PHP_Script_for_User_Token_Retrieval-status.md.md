# Status: BasiqVoyager - Crafting a PHP Script for User Token Retrieval

## Executive Summary 

In this phase, the primary objective was to generate a user token for initiating the consent process using PHP. The journey involved facing challenges, diving deep into the Basiq API documentation, and coming up with a working solution. The next phase will focus on generating an `index.php` for behind our redirect URL, using the token generated by the script we made in phase 7 to output a consent trigger.

## Plan: 

1. **Implement initial PHP script for token generation** 
   - Status: Completed 
2. **Adjust `scope` and `userid` parameters** 
   - Status: Completed 
3. **Set `scope` to `CLIENT_ACCESS`** 
   - Status: Completed 
4. **Generate `index.php` for behind our redirect URL** 
   - Status: Not Started 
5. **Use the token from Phase 7 to output a consent trigger in `index.php`** 
   - Status: Not Started 

## Actions Taken 

| Action | Result | Feedback | Next Step |
|--------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Implement initial PHP script for token generation | Faced "Invalid request body" error | Error message was vague | Adjust `scope` and `userid` parameters |
| Adjust `scope` and `userid` parameters | Faced "Invalid scope specified" error | Error pointed towards the `scope` parameter | Set `scope` to `CLIENT_ACCESS` |
| Set `scope` to `CLIENT_ACCESS` | Successful token generation | Successful integration with Basiq API | Generate `index.php` for redirect URL |

## Loose ends

- Testing the Consent UI flow in sandbox mode.

## Pending actions / Next steps.

| Action | Expected Outcome |
|--------|------------------|
| Generate `index.php` for behind our redirect URL | Successful creation of `index.php` |
| Use the token from Phase 7 in `index.php` | Output a consent trigger for users |
| Integrate the Consent UI into the application | Successful user consent |
| Test the Consent UI flow in sandbox mode | Ensure successful connection to financial institutions |

## Recommended Next Steps 

1. **Generate `index.php` for behind our redirect URL** 
   - Task: Create the `index.php` file and set it up for the redirect URL.
2. **Use the token from Phase 7 to output a consent trigger** 
   - Task: Integrate the token into `index.php` to trigger user consent.
3. **Test the Consent UI Flow with Sandbox Mode** 
   - Task: Use sandbox mode to test the entire flow, ensuring that the user can provide consent and the application can establish a connection to the financial institutions.

Alright, I've made the necessary adjustments. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to tweak or if you need further assistance. Cheers! üçª
