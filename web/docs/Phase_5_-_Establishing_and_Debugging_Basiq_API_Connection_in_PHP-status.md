# Assignment name: BasiqVoyager 

## Executive Summary 

The BasiqVoyager project is currently in Phase 5, which involves implementing the Basiq API into a web application. The project has successfully completed the previous phases, including researching available banking API services and tools, understanding the Basiq API and Dashboard, setting up the development environment, and configuring the Basiq API Dashboard and generating the API key. The current phase has encountered a challenge with the API key, which was already base64 encoded and was being inadvertently encoded again in our PHP script. This issue has been resolved, and the PHP script is now able to successfully connect to the Basiq API.


### Delayed by Rabbits

Before we can start coding properly, we need to get a few more tools setup.

We're at the starting line of getting Visual Studio Code up and running on the Manjaro system. We've got a two-step plan: first, we're going to update the system packages, then we'll dive into the installation. As of now, we're still at the 'on your marks' stage, with the actions yet to kick off. We've got a loose end to tie up - we need to confirm the repository URL and grab the 'rabbits' file. Once we've got that sorted, we're all set to get the ball rolling. You can read more about it in the Visual Studio Code Rabbit document

5. **Phase 5 - Implementing Basiq API into the Web Application**
   - Status: In Progress

## Actions Taken 

| Action | Result | Feedback | Next Step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Research available banking API services and tools | Basiq API selected for integration | Positive | Understand Basiq API and Dashboard |
| Understand Basiq API and Dashboard | Gained knowledge about Basiq API and its dashboard | Positive | Set up the development environment |
| Set up the development environment | Environment set up successfully | Positive | Configure Basiq API Dashboard and generate API key |
| Configure Basiq API Dashboard and generate API key | API key generated successfully | Positive | Implement Basiq API into the web application |
| Implement Basiq API into the web application | Encountered issue with API key encoding | Negative | Debug and resolve the issue |
| Debug and resolve the issue | Issue resolved, API key correctly encoded | Positive | Continue with the implementation of Basiq API into the web application |

## Loose ends

- Finalize the implementation of Basiq API into the web application
  - Test the API integration
  - Debug any issues

## Pending actions  / Next steps.

| Action | Expected Result |
| --- | --- |
| Implement Basiq API into the web application | Successful API integration |
| Test the API integration | Ensure the API is working as expected |
| Debug any issues | Ensure the application is running smoothly |

## Recommended Next Steps 

1. **Implement Basiq API into the Web Application** 
   - Task: Code the API integration into the web application
2. **Test the API Integration**
   - Task: Run tests to ensure the API is working as expected
3. **Debug Any Issues**
   - Task: Fix any issues that arise during testing

## Clean up items

- Review the code and remove any unnecessary comments or debug statements
- Ensure that all sensitive data, such as API keys, are securely stored and not exposed in the code or committed to the repository
- Uninstall any tools or packages that were installed for debugging purposes but are no longer needed

## Conclusion

The BasiqVoyager project is making steady progress towards its goal of integrating the Basiq API into a web application. The team has successfully navigated several phases of the project and has overcome a significant challenge in the current phase. The experience has underscored the importance of a methodical approach to debugging and the value of detailed logging and error reporting. The team is now poised to continue with the implementation of the Basiq API into the web application, with testing and further debugging as the next steps.
