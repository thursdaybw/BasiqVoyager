# A Guide to Integrating the Basiq Consent UI

In the ongoing development of BasiqVoyager, we've reached a pivotal phase: the integration of the Basiq Consent UI. With our API key already secured, we're well-prepared for this next step. Here's a detailed breakdown of the process:

## Preparing the Groundwork: The Callback URL

First and foremost, determine a callback URL for your application. This URL will serve as the landing point post the user's consent process with Basiq. It's essential to ensure that this endpoint is equipped to handle the token provided by Basiq.

## Initiating the Consent UI

- Utilize the reference CURL command to create a PHP script that interacts with Basiq's API. Remember to include your API key for authentication.
- Within this interaction, specify the callback URL you've established.
- Upon successful communication, Basiq will provide a URL for the Consent UI. This URL can be used to redirect users for the consent process.

## User Interaction Process

- Users will be directed to the Consent UI, where they'll select their bank and input their credentials.
- Upon successful consent, Basiq will redirect them back to your specified callback URL, providing a token in the process.

## Handling the Token

- Capture the token at the callback endpoint.
- This token is essential as it grants access to the user's financial data.

## Data Retrieval

- Use the token to interact with Basiq's API and retrieve relevant financial data, such as the account balance.

## Storing and Displaying Data

- Depending on your application's architecture, you might opt to store this data for subsequent use or present it to the user immediately.

It's imperative to prioritize the security and privacy of user data. Handle tokens with utmost care and consider implementing secure methods for their storage and transmission.

With the foundational knowledge of PHP, this integration process should be straightforward. However, should you encounter any challenges or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

**Regarding the PHP Script**:

You'll need a PHP script that can:

1. Interact with Basiq's API using the provided CURL command reference.
2. Retrieve the user's access token.
3. Store the token in a `user_token.txt` file.

This script will serve as both the trigger for the consent process (via a button) and the redirect URL. In subsequent steps, we can import the token from `user_token.txt` for our credential form.
