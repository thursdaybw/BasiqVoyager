## BasiqVoyage - Rabbits

This `rabbits` folder is to store documents and side projects, yak shearing missions, distractions and things we should visit later.

## What are rabbits.

It's a term an old boss of mine used once, I think he said he got it from the Navy. It's like an "off the books" job, like when your captain
comes and sends you off to collect his laundry, it's technically not your job, but your boss wants it.

These are my Rabbits, those things I want but they're a distraction from the mission and the boss can go jump.
