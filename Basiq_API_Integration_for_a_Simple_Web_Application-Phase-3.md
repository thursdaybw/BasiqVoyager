# Project Report: Basiq API Integration for a Simple Web Application - Phase 3

## Executive Summary 

In this phase, we focus on the implementation and testing of the Basiq API integration into the web application. This includes writing the necessary PHP code for API requests, handling responses, retrieving and displaying account balance information, implementing robust error handling, and conducting thorough testing. 

## Challenge Description 

The main challenge in this phase is to successfully integrate the Basiq API into the web application and ensure it functions as expected. This involves not only technical implementation but also robust error handling and comprehensive testing to ensure reliability and accuracy of the data retrieved and displayed.

## Initial plan: 

1. **API Integration**
   - Status: Pending
2. **Data Retrieval and Display**
   - Status: Pending
3. **Error Handling**
   - Status: Pending
4. **Testing**
   - Status: Pending
5. **Refinement and Optimization**
   - Status: Pending
6. **Documentation**
   - Status: Pending

## Actions Taken 

None yet, as this phase is just starting.

## Pending actions

1. Implement the Basiq API into the web application.
2. Retrieve and display account balance information.
3. Implement robust error handling for the API integration.
4. Conduct thorough testing of the Basiq API integration.
5. Refine and optimize the API integration based on testing results.
6. Document the entire process of API integration.

## Loose ends

None at the moment, as this phase is just starting.

## Recommended Next Steps 

1. **API Integration**
   - Task: Write the necessary PHP code to make API requests to Basiq and handle the responses.
   - Status: Pending
2. **Data Retrieval and Display**
   - Task: Retrieve account balance information for a specific savings account at a specific bank using the Basiq API, and display this information in the web application.
   - Status: Pending
3. **Error Handling**
   - Task: Implement robust error handling for the API integration.
   - Status: Pending
4. **Testing**
   - Task: Thoroughly test the Basiq API integration.
   - Status: Pending
5. **Refinement and Optimization**
   - Task: Refine and optimize the API integration based on testing results.
   - Status: Pending
6. **Documentation**
   - Task: Document the entire process of API integration.
   - Status: Pending

## Conclusion 

The project is progressing into an important phase - the actual implementation and testing of the Basiq API integration. This phase will involve technical challenges as well as the need for thorough testing and robust error handling. The goal is to ensure a reliable and accurate integration of the Basiq API into the web application.
